Hi guys,

As most of you know this Friday I will defend my thesis and (hopefully) become a doctoress!!! If I survive until then...

I know many of you are close to this point, which is tough, so I think that is also a good reason to go out for a bit and have a good time!

So, my idea is to get together in Gracia, probably in La Taverna el Glop and have dinner (it is delicious catalan food) and then go to somewhere where we can dance and have a lot of fun :D

Please let me know if you will be able to come and if you are coming with someone so I can make the reservation.

Cheers,
Clara
